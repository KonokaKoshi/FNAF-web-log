                                        Freddy Fazebear&#39;s pizza was once a popular restaurant for 
                                    adults and children alike. However, due to a number of incidents
                                     including the kidnapping and the murder of five children by a man
                                     wearing an empty animatronic suit, sanctions by the Health
                                     Department over the numerous reports of dirtiness, and 
                                    “the bite of 87”, the pizzeria has fallen on hard times. Freddy
                                     Fazbear's Pizza is set to close by the end of the year, as potential 
                                    buyers do not want to be associated with the
                                    tainted reputation of the company.

                                     The four mascots -Freddy fazebear, Bonnie the Bunny,
                                     Chica the Chicken, and Foxy the Pirate had a particularly
                                     foul odor and what appeared to be "blood and mucus"
                                     around their eyes and mouths, which concerned parents had
                                     interpreted as "reanimated carcasses".

                                     Phone Guy remarks in Night 1 phone message that the
                                     animatronic haven't been cleaned in their 20+ years of service, which 
                                    would explain the nasty odor. The stench could also be attributed
                                     to a popular theorythat the missing children were stuffed 
                                    into the animatronic suits after they were killed and that their
                                     decomposing bodies were producing the repulsive smell.
                                     Supposedly, due to the risk of their servos locking up
                                    from disuse, the animatronics have been left in a "free-roaming
                                     mode" at night over the years. They used to be able to roam
                                     freely during the day as well, but The Bite of '87 caused
                                     the pizzeria to put a stop to this.

                                         It was revealed that Phone Guy disappeared sometime before 
                                    the events of the game, as heard during the phone call on 
                                    Night 4 and is implied to have been stuffed into a suit 
                                    and/or killed. There are many  theories as to what happened 
                                    to Phone Guy after the call cuts out, but one can be certain
                                    that he was attacked. There is also speculation about
                                     a more complicated and twisted version of the plot, due to 
                                    the phone message heard during Night 5.
